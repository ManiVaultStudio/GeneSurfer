# GeneSurfer

GeneSurfer is an interactive interface for exploring localized transcriptome-wide gene co-expression patterns in the 3D spatial domain.

This software is described in the paper (bioRxiv link)

## Installation
GeneSurfer is built as a plug-in for the ManiVault application building system. For more information about ManiVault Studio, see [**ManiVault**](https://www.manivault.studio/).

The installer of this software which includes the GeneSurfer plugin can be downloaded [**here**](https://osf.io/eg97r/).

Currently, only a Windows installer is provided, Linux and Mac will follow in the coming period.

## Example Dataset
The Allen Brain Cell Atlas dataset is used to demonstrate the usage of GeneSurfer. To explore this dataset, a minimum of 16GB of memory is required. Download the project file containing this dataset [**here**](https://osf.io/eg97r/).
