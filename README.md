# GeneSurfer

GeneSurfer is an interactive interface for exploring localized transcriptome-wide gene co-expression patterns in the 3D spatial domain.

This software is described in [**GeneSurfer Enables Transcriptome-wide Exploration and Functional Annotation of Gene Co-expression Modules in 3D Spatial Transcriptomics Data**](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.05.602230).

## Installation
GeneSurfer is built as a plug-in for the ManiVault application building system. For more information about ManiVault Studio, see [**ManiVault**](https://www.manivault.studio/).

The installer of this software which includes the GeneSurfer plugin can be downloaded [**here**](https://osf.io/u6cej).

Currently, only a Windows installer is provided, Linux and Mac will follow in the coming period.

## Example Projects and Data
Our main analysis and figures in the paper are based on the Allen Brain Cell Atlas[1]. To reproduce the key results, we recommend downloading the `.mv` [**project file for ABC Atlas**](https://osf.io/47z2y), which contains saved UI configurations and data. A minimum of 16GB memory is required, 32GB+ recommended.

To demonstrate GeneSurfer's general applicability, we also tested it on datasets from other spatial transcriptomics platforms. All files are available via [**our OSF repository**](https://osf.io/eg97r/wiki/).
