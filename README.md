# GeneSurfer

GeneSurfer is an interactive interface for exploring localized transcriptome-wide gene co-expression patterns in the 3D spatial domain.

This software is described in the paper (bioRxiv link)

## Installation
GeneSurfer is built as a plug-in for the ManiVault application building system. For more information about ManiVault Studio, see [**ManiVault**](https://www.manivault.studio/).

The installer of this software which includes the GeneSurfer plugin can be downloaded below:

(OSF link)

Currently, only a Windows installer is provided, Linux and Mac will follow in the coming period.

## Example Dataset
The Allen Brain Cell Atlas dataset is used to demonstrate the usage of GeneSurfer. Download the project file containing this dataset here: (OSF link)
