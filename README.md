# GeneSurfer

GeneSurfer is an interactive interface for exploring localized transcriptome-wide gene co-expression patterns in the 3D spatial domain.

This software is described in the paper (bioRxiv link)

## Installation
GeneSurfer is built as a plug-in for the ManiVault application building system. For more information about ManiVault, see [**ManiVault: A Flexible and Extensible Visual Analytics Framework for High-Dimensional Data**](https://www.manivault.studio/).

The installer of this software which includes the GeneSurfer plugin can be downloaded below:
